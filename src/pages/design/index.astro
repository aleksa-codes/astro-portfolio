      "I was looking for a local web designer and found Forest Designs. Finding someone without a referral and trusting they can complete the job is difficult. Thankfully they did an excellent job, and completed the new website quickly. They just didn't build the site, they did research and went to extra work to ensure the site turned out great.",

As a result, our Cedar Rapids customers notice anywhere from a slight to a marked improvement in their SEO. However, Google's recent algorithm updates put the nail in the coffin of easy SEO. If you want to do well in the search results, you need both a great website and active work on your off-site SEO.",
