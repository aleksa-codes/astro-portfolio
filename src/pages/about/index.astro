      <p>
        Born in 1996, I was raised during the digital revolution. As a teenager, I developed a passion for building
        websites and became increasingly fascinated by the digital economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing high school, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in <span class='highlight'>Computer Science</span> at
        Singidunum University, complementing my studies with a variety of online courses to enhance my knowledge and abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an passionate and motivated <span class='highlight'>full-stack web developer</span>, I'm always eager to
        transform ideas into applications. My goal is to stay at the forefront of the ever-changing <span
          class='highlight'>web development</span
        > world, actively seeking new learning opportunities and projects to continue improving my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my work, I strive to create <span class='highlight'>modern, responsive websites and applications</span> that meet
        the needs and desires of my clients, while also finding innovative solutions to problems through collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my free time, I enjoy traveling, watching movies or playing basketball and video games. I also have a
        soft spot for cats and relish the opportunity to pet them whenever possible. ðŸ˜¸
