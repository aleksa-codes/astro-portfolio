  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Born in 1996, I was raised during the digital revolution. As a teenager, I developed a passion for building websites
    and became increasingly fascinated by the digital economy.
  </p>
  <p>
    After finishing high school, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in <span class='highlight'>Computer Science</span> at Singidunum
    University, complementing my studies with a variety of online courses to enhance my knowledge and abilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an passionate and motivated <span class='highlight'>full-stack web developer</span>, I'm always eager to
    transform ideas into applications. My goal is to stay at the forefront of the ever-changing <span class='highlight'
      >web development</span
    > world, actively seeking new learning opportunities and projects to continue improving my skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my work, I strive to create <span class='highlight'>modern, responsive websites and applications</span> that meet
    the needs and desires of my clients, while also finding innovative solutions to problems through collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my free time, I enjoy traveling, watching movies or playing basketball and video games. I also have a soft
    spot for cats and relish the opportunity to pet them whenever possible. ðŸ˜¸
