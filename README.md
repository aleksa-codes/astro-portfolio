## Demo

Demo for this project is available @ [aleksa.codes](https://aleksa.codes)

This portfolio/blog was inspired and built on top of: https://daisy-blog.netlify.app/ by [@saadeghi](https://github.com/saadeghi),
the creator of daisyUI.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll find the following directories and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
        ...
â””â”€â”€ package.json
    ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command             | Action                                                                                       |
