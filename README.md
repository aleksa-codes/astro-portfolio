## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
        ...
└── package.json
    ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `yarn dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `yarn build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `yarn preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `yarn astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `yarn astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

** if you are using npm -> just use `npm run` instead of `yarn'
